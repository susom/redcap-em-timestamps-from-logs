##Timestamps from logs

#### Description
Created for Sinonasal project

Surveys were collected without a date stamp. Occasionally the forms were manually entered and so the
survey timestamps are not available.

We are using a history timestamp (from redcap_log_events) of a proxy field to be serve as the timestamp
for the form.  


#### Setup

**1. Enter the proxy-field from which to gather the timestamp**

**2. Enter the target-field to which to save the timestamp**

**3. Optionally, select a checkbox field to identify the timestamp as log derived**
